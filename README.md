##  Project Categories

### Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics

- **[Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/RachanaAmgai/Project1-Predicting-Customer-Churn)**  
  Built a classification model to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. Included EDA, feature engineering, and comparison of multiple machine learning models to support retention strategies.

- **[Project 2: Walmart Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/RachanaAmgai/Project2-walmart-sales-prediction)**  
  Applied regression and time series forecasting to Walmart’s weekly sales data to help optimize inventory management and staffing. Explored Random Forest, ARIMA, and data merging techniques.

- **[Project 3: Predicting Default Credit Case Study](https://github.com/RachanaAmgai/Project3-Predicting-Default-Credit-Case-Study)**  
  Designed a model to predict whether a borrower will experience serious delinquency (90+ days overdue) using financial and demographic features. Employed Random Forest, CatBoost, SHAP values, and LIME for interpretability.
