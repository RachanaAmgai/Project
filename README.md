#  Rachana Amgai's Data Science Project Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Project Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my real-world projects, completed as part of my journey as a data science student. These projects demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

---

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict real-world outcomes using structured data. Each project in this portfolio addresses a unique business problem—such as customer churn, credit default, or sales forecasting—with the goal of delivering actionable insights that can support smarter decision-making.

This portfolio serves as:
- Demonstrate practical applications of data science in business contexts

- Improve prediction accuracy through proper preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

- Promote responsible AI practices using interpretability tools like SHAP and LIME

- Support organizations in minimizing risk, optimizing operations, and enhancing customer experience

##  Project Categories

### Machine Learning & Predictive Analytics

- **[Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/RachanaAmgai/Project1-Predicting-Customer-Churn)**  
 This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning. The workflow includes data exploration, feature engineering, class balancing (using SMOTE), and modeling with algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks. Evaluation is based on recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, with special attention to interpretability and fairness.

- **[Project 2: Walmart Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/RachanaAmgai/Project2-walmart-sales-prediction)**  
  This project applies machine learning to forecast weekly sales for Walmart stores at the department level. Applied regression and time series forecasting to Walmart’s weekly sales data to help optimize inventory management and staffing. Explored Random Forest, ARIMA, and data merging techniques.

- **[Project 3: Predicting Default Credit Case Study](https://github.com/RachanaAmgai/Project3-Predicting-Default-Credit-Case-Study)**  
 This project focuses on predicting serious credit delinquency—defined as borrowers falling over 90 days behind on payments—using demographic and financial history data. The dataset, sourced from European credit card transactions, is highly imbalanced, with defaults representing only 0.172% of cases. We applied data cleaning, outlier handling, and advanced feature engineering to prepare the dataset. SHAP and LIME were used to explain model predictions, revealing credit usage and delinquency history as key predictors.
